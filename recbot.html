    <h3>Enabling modular low-cost recording of swimming</h3>
    <p>
        Using a network of inertial sensors, swimmers can record their movement without resorting
        to bulky multi-camera setups and manual digitalziation. The Double Diamond <a href="#references">[1]</a>
        methodology, divided in divergent and convergent phases, was used. The first phase is Discovery, where
        a contextual research is made, and is followed by Define, when a design opportunity
        is pinpointed.

            <h3>Stakeholder mapping</h3>
            <p>The project started with an immersion into the swimming context, on its professional, amateur and
                academic spheres. Three major stakeholders/user groups were defined:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="centered">
            <h6>discover</h6>
            <img src="images/triangle.png" alt="">
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="multi-pane triptych">
        <div>
            <img src="images/nadador-square.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>1) Swimmers</h6>
            <p>The primary user group. To get to know this user group, qualitative interviews
                were conducted with amateur swimmers
                at a competition.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/treinador-square.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>2) Coaches</h6>
            <p>A secondary user group. A training session of professional swimmers was observed, and
                the coach interviewed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/pesquisador-square.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>3) Researchers</h6>
            <p>Another secondary user group. Observation of the process of swimming data collection
                and analysis was carried to understand the state of the art of the field.</p>

            <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
            <p>The findings of user research, backed by desk research on swimming theory, point to
                swimming technique as the aspect users would benefit the most from accessing quantitative data
                and visualization <a href="#references">[2]</a>, <a href="#references">[3]</a>. Therefore, the project
                objective became:
                <span class="highlight-1">"Provide relevant information
                    about the athletes swimming technique, to enhance his or hers performance"</span>.

    <div class="full divider">
        <h6>The second diamond</h6>
        <p>Discover and Define are followed by the divergent Develop phase, where ideation on a concept
            is made, followed by a convergent Deliver phase where it's scope is settled and it is
            prepared for shipping or production.</p>

            <h3>Analyzing competing products</h3>
            <p>After defining the problem to be tackled, an analysis of products that tried to accomplish this
                same task was conducted.
                The products and systems that could enable users to visualize their swimming technique as well
                as provide quantitative data on performance could be divided into two main groups:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="centered">
            <h6>develop</h6>
            <img src="images/triangle.png" alt="">
        </div>

    <div class="multi-pane">
        <div>
            <img src="images/similarvideo.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>Videogrametry</h6>
            <p>Camera-based systems, as the one observed in the user research phase, that film the athletes
                movement through multiple perspectives and digitalize it into a tridimensional representation, or, if
                only
                one camera is used, offers simple playback. Water bubbles and refraction diminish the acuracy of
                underwater
                cameras.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/similarins.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>Inertial sensors</h6>
            <p>Based on miniaturized accelerometer and gyroscopes, also known as MEMS, these are used in fitness
                trackers to provide metrics on user movement. In one product they were used
                concatenated, providing full-body motion capture.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Ideation and selection</h3>
    <img class="full" src="images/recbotalternativas.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Adding to the similar products research, alternative solutions were brainstormed.
        The main three alternatives groups could be clustered in:</p>

    <div class="multi-pane triptych">
        <div class="pane">
            <img src="images/altsoundCrop.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>1) Ultrassound system</h6>
            <p>A set of ultrassound or similar waves transceivers would be placed on the
                pool, and another on the swimmers body, to capture the movement. It was not used because the
                air-water change of medium rendered the time-of-flight of the waves unreliable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pane">
            <img src="images/altvideoCrop.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>2) Facilitated videogrametry</h6>
            <p>Inspired on the present state-of-art, a number of alternatives to make it
                the system easier to assemble or permitting the automation of digitalization were proposed. However,
                they
                still relied on the multi-camera setup that was found too difficult to be applied in the first
                place by all stakeholders but the researchers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pane">
            <img src="images/altinsCrop.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>3) Inertial sensors</h6>
            <p>A network of inertial sensors, in form of a swimming vest or set of
                modular straps would record the motion that then could be visualized on a third-party device
                such as a computer or smartphone, with appropriate software.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Employing user research to back up design decisions</h3>
    <p> The user needs that surfaced during research were translated into project requirements, that
        were then weighted acording to the number of stakeholder groups that had them. This way,
        the similar products and generated alternatives could be scored as to how closely they attend these needs.
        <span class="highlight-1">The modular wearable of inertial sensors fared the best
            on the comparison, and thus was taken into further development.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Usage scenarios</h3>
    <p>The scope of the project encompassed the specification of a physical product, as well as the
        logical definition of the system and user experience. To inform the creation of these, three
        usage scenarios were explored:</p>

    <div class="multi-pane triptych">
        <div>
            <img src="images/recbotscenario1.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>1) Single user</h6>
            <p>A swimmer buys from one to fifteen modules (number used to record the most relevant
                body segments) to capture his own movement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/recbotscenario2.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>2) Solidary users</h6>
            <p>A group of swimmers buys one module each, to use as fitness trackers, and eventually
                comes together to record their full body motion using their modules in tandem..</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/recbotscenario3.jpg" alt="">
            <h6>3) Service users</h6>
            <p>A coach or swimming school buys one or more sets of modules, and use them to
                record students movement during class.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>From these scenarios, a generic, all-encompassing flowchart of the product part of
        the system was devised.
        Then, a table of states, actions, errors and solutions was developed in order to shed light
        into the design solution through an interaction point of view <a href="#references">[4]</a>.</p>

    <div class="multi-pane new-section">
        <div class="section-pane">
            <h3>Defining the product subsystems</h3>
            <p>Informed by the usage flowchart and table, several subsystems of the product were devised and
                developed.</p>
        </div>

    <h3>Software flowchart</h3>
    <p>
        Also, a usage flowchart for the product software was created, containing all the actions and
        responses needed for the system to work. The coding of the software however, was out of the
        projects scope.
    </p>

    <img class="full" src="images/appflow.jpg" alt="">


    <h3>The Recbot</h3>
    <p>The Recbot is a modular system for motion capture comprised of one or more modules to be worn on
        the body segments: hands, arms, forearms, legs, forelegs, feet, waist, chest and head. Creating
        an ad hoc Bluetooth low-energy network, the data (acceleration and angular velocity) of all the
        sensors, recorded internally, can be transferred to a third-party device that processes and
        concatenates all of it. Thus, it can later be used to animate a 3D rigged character, for movement
        visualization, or provide metrics on the performance (such as speed, stroke count and stroke lenght).</p>

                Special attention was paid to this point because
                the modules have to placed in a specific orientation in order for the centralized data to work
                correctly. <a href="https://sketchfab.com/models/36ae27808ad2403485fb89b91972aadb">See in interactive

    <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
    <p>My Bachelor thesis project allowed me to join the overall design process with a deeper understanding
        of technical development, through a holistic approach
        While the overarching Double Diamond method is employed, other specific methods, such as Garret's
        Elements of user Experience, and wearable development methodologies were consulted <a
            href="#references">[5]</a>.
        This way, I tried
        to ensure the most impactful project for the users, while accounting for the technologic
        possibilities.<br><br>
