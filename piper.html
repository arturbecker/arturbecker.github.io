    <p>UX/UI Design, software for designing rigid Oil & Gas pipelines.
      Summer internship project at the Digital Services and Innovation (DSI)
      department at TechnipFMC. DSI’s goal is to act as an innovation hub inside of the massive organization it is in. I
      joined three other interns (Helene Stenstadvold the designer, Anthony Genson the developer and Piri Babayev the
      data scientist) to form a squad to tackle one such innovation: re-thinking rigid pipeline design.
    </p>

    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p>The project started with a kick-off discovery and framing (DnF) workshop with senior members of the department,
      stakeholders (aka the rigid pipeline engineering manager), and our day-to-day ally in the project: André Levy the
      rigid
      pipeline engineering intern.

      The purpose of the DnF was to help our squad establish an initial understanding of the problem domain, and try to
      start forming a shared vision for the project.

    <h3>UX research</h3>
    <p>
      Following the DnF, we immersed ourselves in all things subsea engineering. This ranged from trying to use the
      current tools the subsea engineers had (a collection of spreadsheets for doing the several needed calculations to
      lay a pipe in the deeps of the ocean) to venturing downstairs to observe the engineers actually using it, to
      interviewing them about how they felt about designing pipelines.

      The outcome of this research phase solidified into two personas and their respective journeys: one had a
      management role, while the other was a newly arrived intern working on their first project. As we understood the
      different needs of these personas, it became clear our intervention <span class="highlight-1">shouldn’t be solely
        managerial focused</span>,
      neither <span class="highlight-2">solely engineering focused</span>. We could achieve a larger impact by building
      a common platform to enable both
      management and engineers to perform their best work.

    <h3>Product design</h3>
    <p>We started designing the core of our product - basically an authoring tool for rigid pipelines - that would
      enable us to gather all the pipeline design information in one place (well, the Cloud). Having the data in one
      place would then make analyzing it much easier (than hunting for spreadsheets of past projects, scattered across
      different computers and servers). It could also help bootstrap the beginners workflow: “What do other projects
      similar to mine look like and what can I learn from them?”.
      The UI design process took a lot of iterations (again, going downstairs to usability test the medium- and
      high-fidelity prototypes with about a dozen engineers).
      At this point we were confident we could deliver an usable tool for performing pipeline design calculations.
      However, we had a technical breakthrough: thanks to the modern computational backbone implemented by our data
      scientist and our developer, we could perform the calculations about 60,000 times faster. This opened up the
      design space to make the most use of the newfound efficiency. Thus we performed a new iterative round of
      interaction design and usability testing.

    <p>We cleverly named our product “Piper” (Helene's idea). In its core Piper is a welcoming and supportive rigid
      pipeline design
      tool. It makes use of a <span class="highlight-2">wizard-like design to guide newcomers</span>, while keeping
      fully functional keyboard-based
      navigation for expert users. Not only does it calculate what you asked it to, it can help you <span
        class="highlight-1">explore hundreds of
        variations at a glimpse</span>. This massively reduced the time spent inputting data into the system, while
      allowing the
      engineers to think critically and make the crucial problem solving they need to do (and also thoroughly enjoy).
      Piper also lets you explore the wealth of information on all the other rigid pipelines already successfully
      deployed by the company, and build on the knowledge obtained from them.

    <h3>Role and conclusion</h3>
    <p>Piper was the outcome from my summer internship at TechnipFMC. The MVP of the software (comprising the
      wizard-like creation of pipeline designs) was completed by Anthony and Piri during the internship.
      Me and Helene went forward with the prototype a little more, towards way to use Piper to explore and compare
      pipelines, as well as making it easier to find the best designs.</p>
    <p>
      The whole team participated on the design and software modelling decisions we took along the way. My background in
      Data Visualization informed the concepts for browsing the pipeline designs using dimensional reduction and the
      matrix-like disposition of the designs. The final Figma prototype of those parts of Piper was also done by me.
