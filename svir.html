    <p>Prototype of an AI-powered urine test app for detecting UTIs at home. I was approached by two data scientists and
      two doctors to design an app for helping with the diagnostic of Urinary tract infection (UTI) using AI. As the
      project sole designer,
      I acted on product discovery and prototype testing. My participation lasted around 6 months.

    <h3>Assumption user journeys â†’<br>
      Actual journeys</h3>
    <p>I kicked off the design at svir.no with a collective exercise: together with the two data scientists, Jonas and
      Esten, we literally came
      up with what we assumed would be the journey of a person experiencing UTI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people afflicted by UTI are women - and it was a somewhat alien concept to us. Putting our thoughts on paper,
      comparing them, and realizing they were assumptions was a good exercise to
      pinpoint where our undestanding of the problem was fuzzy.
      This informed the interview script. Then I carried out interviews with five people who (actually) had UTI, where
      they shared their UTI stories.
    </p>

    <h3>Brand sprint</h3>
    <p>Another exercise I facilitated with the team, including the doctors - Henry and Kambiz - was a three-hour brand
      sprint from Google Ventures. We used the sprint to align the objectives of the enterprise: why are we doing this?
      where do we see svir in 20 years? Some feedback from the sessions was: <span class="highlight-1">"I never stopped
        to think about this things before"</span>.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Deciding on a hypothesis</h3>
    <p>After the brand sprint and the interviews, the team was struck with a dilemma - what hypothesis should we tackle
      first:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight-2">A feasibility hypothesis, to validate whether we could develop an AI-model to read
        the urine tests accurately</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight-3">A usability hypothesis, to validate whether people could actually perform an
        AI-augmented urine test by
        themselves</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Being strapped for resources, I argued for <span class="highlight-3">building a prototype to test the usability
        hypothesis</span> - while trying to
      validate the utility hypothesis as cheaply as possible by <span class="highlight-2">manually collecting test
        samples</span>.
      Another hypothesis we didn't get around to test was a value hypothesis, to validate whether people would value the
      product enough to buy it and make our work worthwhile.
    </p>


    <h3>Prototyping and user testing</h3>
    <p>In the final arc of my participation in the project, I built a Figma prototype to help simulate the experience of
      taking the AI-augmented urine test.
      To complete the simulation, I used actual test strips and the color calibration card (originally designed to help
      with the data collection).
      Each user was presented with the following scenario: you had UTI before and are feeling similar symptoms. You
      bought this product at a nearby pharmacy
      and downloaded the smartphone app instructed in the packaging. Follow the instructions on screen to perform the
      urine test (for the user tests, a cup of water replaced the urine).</p>

    <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
    <p>Although all users managed to go through the entire prototype flow, only one out of three would managed to not
      invalidate the test by submerging the test strip for too long in the water.
      This showed that the instructions could be improved - and revealed the hardship of trying to control real-life
      behavior from inside of an app.
    <p>
      Another finding from the tests is that, upon inquiry,
      all users felt uncomfortable with using a glass cup to hold the urine for the test - which hints for the
      inclusion
      of a disposable cup in the package.
    </p>  
    <p>
      This project was unique to me in the sense that I felt the weight of all product decisions: is this the right
      product? Is this even legal? How can we know this will sell without going through all the trouble of building it
      first?
      I am trying to gain more perspective on these questions. My consultancy ended after the prototype test. The
      Figma
      file was later used as guidance to build an MVP of the app.
