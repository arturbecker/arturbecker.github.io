			<h3 class=paratitle>
			Using a network of inertial sensors, swimmers can record their movement without resorting
to bulky multi-camera setups and manual digitalziation. The Double Diamond <a href="#references">[1]</a> methodology,
divided in divergent and convergent phases, was used. The first phase is Discovery, where
a contextual research is made, and is followed by Define, when a design opportunity
is pinpointed.

swimming technique as the aspect users would benefit the most from accessing quantitative data

The products and systems that could enable users to visualize their swimming technique as well

				Camera-based systems, as the one observed in the user research phase, that film the athletes
movement through multiple perspectives and digitalize it into a tridimensional representation, or, if only
one camera is used, offers simple playback. Water bubbles and refraction diminish the acuracy of underwater
cameras.

trackers to provide metrics on user movement. In one product they were used
concatenated, providing full-body motion capture.

				<p class="text">
A set of ultrassound or similar waves transceivers would be placed on the
pool, and another on the swimmers body, to capture the movement. It was not used because the
air-water change of medium rendered the time-of-flight of the waves unreliable.

Inspired on the present state-of-art, a number of alternatives to make it
the system easier to assemble or permitting the automation of digitalization were proposed. However, they
still relied on the multi-camera setup that was found too difficult to be applied in the first
place by all stakeholders but the researchers.

modular straps would record the motion that then could be visualized on a third-party device
such as a computer or smartphone, with appropriate software.

				The Recbot is a modular system for motion capture comprised of one or more modules to be worn on
the body segments: hands, arms, forearms, legs, forelegs, feet, waist, chest and head. Creating
an ad hoc Bluetooth low-energy network, the data (acceleration and angular velocity) of all the
sensors, recorded internally, can be transferred to a third-party device that processes and
concatenates all of it. Thus, it can later be used to animate a 3D rigged character, for movement
visualization, or provide metrics on the performance (such as speed, stroke count and stroke lenght).
