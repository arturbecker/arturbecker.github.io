        <p>Interaction design, a modular approach to searching - facilitating information search through Interaction
            Design. This project had it's inception during the Interaction
            Design course at the Industrial Design Intensive from UID, and ended winning an annual digital innovation
            call from a <a href="http://fort-knox.se">company in Umeå</a>, competing
            with other projects from tech, business and design students.</p>

            <h2>The library project</h2>
            <p>The interaction design project at IDI aims to help the university library to accomplish its
                mission: "Facilitate reasearch and education at Umea University", by proposing redesigns to its
                website.</p>

        <h2>User groups</h2>

        <p>We sought to understand how the library mission was perceived by its users, dividing these into
            smaller groups: students and researches, as part of the academic community; and "teenage bookworms",
            that are not (yet) inside the university but might search books in its large catalog. After interviews with
            users from each group, we created personas to represent them.</p>

        <p>Partnering with the librarians, a workshop was arranged with primary school children seeking to find

            they would catalog and classify information (represented by different objects laid on the floor).</p>

    <section>
        <p>The research phase brought the key insight that users interact with the library website
            in different ways, and to appeal to them, the library website had to manage to accomodate the different
            possible mindsets. Three alternatives of redesigns for the library website were proposed:</p>

            <p>An overhaul of the website focusing on making the navigation of its internal categories

            <h6>3) Venn diagram exploratory search</h6>
            <p>An alternative search interface for the catalog, using Venn diagrams to intersect interest
                areas and explore new books.</p>

            <p> From these alternatives, we found that the most impactful on accomplishing the library mission
                would be the redesign of its overall most-used feature: the search engine.

                The Venn diagram approach, however, could not be used due to it's restriction to three
                intersecting sets, using perfect circles. Therefore, we retinkered the idea based on the
                tree-like navigation design of alternative 1.</p>

        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <p>With the new concept under development, Lo-fi mockups of the interface were printed

            <h2>Concept: Visual search interface</h2>
            <p> A modular search interface that expands according to the users will to refine it. It accounts for the
                multiple
                ways different users might want to build their own search: <a href="#student"><span
                        class="highlight-1">whether
                        searching for the title exactly</span></a>,
                <a href="#researcher"><span class="highlight-2">creating personalized search feeds of specific interest
                        areas</span></a> or <a href="#bookworm"><span class="highlight-3">allowing exploration through
                        keyword suggestion</span></a>. Relying only on current databases and supported boolean algebra,
                it helps the user
                create searches iteratively, permitting the bypass of filtering steps to check the effect a certain
                filter has on the final search, while reducing greatly the number of page transfers with an in loco
                refreshing interface.

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>This project started during IDI, where I worked together with Victor Muñoz and Melina Hozhabri.
            After the the final concept was presented to the university librarians, and the IDI project
            was over, our team parted ways and I kept working solo on the graphic presentation and logic of the system
            to enter
            the Remus Technologies (now Fort Knox) Innovation Call.
            Having won it, I worked two more months developing a blueprint for the interface and guiding
            the development of a digital prototyped with a hired programmer. With this shipped, the intellectual
            rights to the project are now owned by the company, through a royalties contract.
