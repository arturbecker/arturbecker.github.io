			THE LIBRARY PROJECT

mission: "Facilitate reasearch and education at Umea University", by proposing redesigns to its
website.

			USER GROUPS
			</h2>
				<h3 class=paratitle>
				We sought to understand how the library mission was perceived by its users, dividing these into
smaller groups: students and researches, as part of the academic community; and "teenage bookworms",
that are not (yet) inside the university but might search books in its large catalog. After interviews with
users from each group, we created personas to represent them.

				The research phase brought the key insight that users interact with the library website
in different ways, and to appeal to them, the library website had to manage to accomodate the different
possible mindsets. Three alternatives of redesigns for the library website were proposed:

				</h3>
				<p class="text">
An overhaul of the website focusing on making the navigation of its internal categories
easier to understand, through a tree-like interface.

				<img class="img" src="../images/libraryalt02.jpg"></img>
				<h3 class="paratitlecenter">2) Log-in encouraging interface</h3>
				</h3>
				<p class="text">
A more subtle rework of the website aiming to encourage the user to log in to the library network
- an action, that acording to the librarians interviewed, greatly enhanced the suer experience.

			<div class="column3">
				<img class="img" src="../images/libraryalt03.png"></img>
				<h3 class="paratitlecenter">3) Venn diagram exploratory search</h3>
				<p class="text">
An alternative search interface for the catalog, using Venn diagrams to intersect interest
areas and explore new books.

		<div class="inline" id="preimg">

				<h3 class=paratitle>
				From these alternatives, we found that the most impactful on accomplishing the library mission
would be the redesign of its overall most-used feature: the search engine.

The Venn diagram approach, however, could not be used due to it's restriction to three
intersecting sets, using perfect circles. Therefore, we retinkered the idea based on the
tree-like navigation design of alternative 1.

			CONCEPT: VISUAL SEARCH INTERFACE
			</h2>
		<div class="inline" id="preimg">
		<div class="column">
			<h3 class=paratitle>
A modular search interface that expands according to the users will to refine it. It accounts for the multiple
ways different users might want to build their own search: <a href="#student"><span id=yellow>whether searching for the title exactly</span></a>,
<a href="#researcher"><span id="green">creating personalized search feeds of specific interest areas</span></a> or <a href="#bookworm"><span id="pink">allowing exploration through
keyword suggestion</span></a>. Relying only on current databases and supported boolean algebra, it helps the user
create searches iteratively, permitting the bypass of filtering steps to check the effect a certain
filter has on the final search, while reducing greatly the number of page transfers with an in loco
refreshing interface.

	<h2 id="conclusion">ROLE IN THE PROJECT AND FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
				<h3 class=paratitlecenter>This project started during IDI, where I worked together with Victor Mu√±oz and Melina Hozhabri. </h3>
				<p class="text">
After the the final concept was presented to the university librarians, and the IDI project
was over, our team parted ways and I kept working solo on the graphic presentation and logic of the system to enter
the Remus Technologies (now Fort Knox) Innovation Call.
Having won it, I worked two more months developing a blueprint for the interface and guiding
the development of a digital prototyped with a hired programmer. With this shipped, the intellectual
rights to the project are now owned by the company, through a royalties contract.
