      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

		<h3 class=paratitlecenter>The project was done during the Industrial Design Intensive programme at UID, by me
			and Felix Noller.</h3>
		<p class="text">
			The inception of the devices came from Felix, who then approached me to tinker the concept together. Later,
			Felix handled the Arduino programming and I took care
			of the witty labelling for the scores, as well as the closing circuit game. With the footage captured
			by both of us, I edited the project video on Blender.

			FUTURISTIC,<br />"FLOATING"<br />FLATWARE
		</h2>
		<h3 class=paratitlecenter>
			Inova Diamond is a flatware series designed for a large brazilian manufacturer.
		</h3>
		<p class="text">The Inova line bestows the feature of preventing the blade of the silverware from
			touching the surface beneath it. The Diamond models, thus, keep such feature while being
			reshaped with a completely different design language. The main goal of this project
			was to aid the manufacturer to position a simple, low cost polymer flatware
			as innovative and premium.

				<div class=column>
					<h3 class=paratitle>The geometric lines culminate in the diamond-shaped back of the grip</h3>
					<p class="imgtext">The reasoning behind choosing a mostly geometric, polygonal design language was
						to deviate from <a href="../images/inovadplus.png">the previous Inova line</a>, and most similar
						products for that matter,
						that employ curved, organic forms on the grips. It has a similar mass to its predecessor, not
						increasing manufacturing costs.

					<h3 class=paratitle>Organic doesn't necessarily mean "ergonomic", and vice-versa</h3>
					<p class="imgtext">During the ideation phase, the main theoretical touchstone was brazilian
						ergonomist Itiro Iida's chapter on
						grips and small utensils, where it's pointed out that while geometrically shaped grips
						might not seem anatomical at first, they are well suited for longer handling periods
						with low force exertion, because they allow for multiple hand positions (more
						anatomically resembling grips, however, are better suited for shorter, higher force usage)
						<a href=#references>[1]</a>. A live example of such concept is <a
							href="http://konstantin-grcic.com/resources/534.jpg">the chair _ONE</a>, by Konstantin
						Grcic.<br><br>The dimensions of faces (a) and (b) - the only in contact with the surface below -
						were
						finetuned through several rapid prototyping iterations, to find the optimal trade-off between
						stability
						and handling comfort.

			<h3 class=paratitlecenter>Prototyping was crucial to find a pleasant grip that still wouldn't tumble over
			</h3>
			<p class="text">The sequential iterations of the grip design (from top to bottom) were 3D printed in two
				halves, and had blades provided by the manufacturer attached to one end.
				The last one, in black, is an injection test. The prototypes were then brought to lunch at restaurants,
				to be tested.

		<h2>ROLE IN THE PROJECT AND FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
		<h3 class=paratitlecenter>Inova Diamond was the project at which I had the most independence as an intern at
			Grupo Criativo</h3>
		<p class="text">Of the design projects I took part during my internship (ranging from food trays to etnography
			research of artisanal bakers) the Diamond was the longest.
			I believe it was so especially due to the incentive from coworkers, among them my supervisor, Gabriel
			Altenhofen, who had designed the previous Inova model, to see how far the design could be pushed and
			finetuned.
			Eventhough the ideation and modelling were done mostly solo, input from the team was always present and
			taken into consideration (such as turning the diamond up, when originally it was inverted). Gabriel was
			responsible for finetuning the
			fillets on the six-edge vertex on the bottom side of the grip, that demanded special attention.
