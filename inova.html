		<p>Product design, geometric flatware designed to not tumble over. This was my first professional industrial
			design
			project, during an internship. I spent around four weeks working on it from loose concept to render-ready CAD
			model. It went on to be manufactured by the company that comissioned the project.</p>

		<p>Inova Diamond is a flatware series designed for a large brazilian manufacturer. The Inova line bestows the
			feature of preventing the blade of the silverware from touching the surface beneath it. The Diamond models,
			thus, keep such feature while being
			reshaped with a completely different design language. The main goal of this project
			was to aid the manufacturer to position a simple, low cost polymer flatware
			as innovative and premium.</p>

		<h3>Designing the diamond</h3>
		<p>The geometric lines culminate in the diamond-shaped back of the grip. The reasoning behind choosing a mostly
			geometric, polygonal design language was
			to deviate from <a href="../images/inovadplus.png">the previous Inova line</a>, and most similar
			products for that matter,
			that employ curved, organic forms on the grips. It has a similar mass to its predecessor, not
			increasing manufacturing costs.</p>
		<img src="../images/diamondBack.png" alt="">

		<p>Organic doesn't necessarily mean "ergonomic", and vice-versa
			During the ideation phase, the main theoretical touchstone was brazilian
			ergonomist Itiro Iida's chapter on
			grips and small utensils, where it's pointed out that while geometrically shaped grips
			might not seem anatomical at first, they are well suited for longer handling periods
			with low force exertion, because they allow for multiple hand positions (more
			anatomically resembling grips, however, are better suited for shorter, higher force usage)
			<a href=#references>[1]</a>. A live example of such concept is <a
				href="http://konstantin-grcic.com/resources/534.jpg">the chair _ONE</a>, by Konstantin
			Grcic.<br><br>The dimensions of faces (a) and (b) - the only in contact with the surface below -
			were
			finetuned through several rapid prototyping iterations, to find the optimal trade-off between
			stability
			and handling comfort.

		<h3>Rapid prototyping</h3>
		<p>Prototyping was crucial to find a pleasant grip that still wouldn't tumble over
			The sequential iterations of the grip design (from top to bottom) were 3D printed in two
			halves, and had blades provided by the manufacturer attached to one end.
			The last one, in black, is an injection test. The prototypes were then brought to lunch at restaurants,
			to be tested.

		<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
		<p> Inova Diamond was the project at which I had the most independence as an intern at
			Grupo Criativo. It was the long of the design projects I took part during my internship (which ranged from
			food trays to etnography
			research of artisanal bakers).
			I believe it was so especially due to the incentive from coworkers, among them my supervisor, Gabriel
			Altenhofen, who had designed the previous Inova model, to see how far the design could be pushed and
			finetuned.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventhough the ideation and modelling were done mostly solo, input from the team was always present and
			taken into consideration (such as turning the diamond up, when originally it was upside down).
			To hand-off for manufacturing, Gabriel was
			responsible for finetuning the
			fillets on the six-edge vertex on the bottom side of the grip, that demanded special attention.
