		<p>Inova Diamond is a flatware series designed for a large brazilian manufacturer. The Inova line bestows the
			feature of preventing the blade of the silverware from touching the surface beneath it. The Diamond models,
			thus, keep such feature while being
			reshaped with a completely different design language. The main goal of this project
			was to aid the manufacturer to position a simple, low cost polymer flatware
			as innovative and premium.</p>

		<h2>Designing the diamond</h2>
		<p>The geometric lines culminate in the diamond-shaped back of the grip. The reasoning behind choosing a mostly
			geometric, polygonal design language was
			to deviate from <a href="../images/inovadplus.png">the previous Inova line</a>, and most similar
			products for that matter,
			that employ curved, organic forms on the grips. It has a similar mass to its predecessor, not
			increasing manufacturing costs.</p>

		<p>Organic doesn't necessarily mean "ergonomic", and vice-versa
			During the ideation phase, the main theoretical touchstone was brazilian
			ergonomist Itiro Iida's chapter on
			grips and small utensils, where it's pointed out that while geometrically shaped grips
			might not seem anatomical at first, they are well suited for longer handling periods
			with low force exertion, because they allow for multiple hand positions (more
			anatomically resembling grips, however, are better suited for shorter, higher force usage)
			<a href=#references>[1]</a>. A live example of such concept is <a
				href="http://konstantin-grcic.com/resources/534.jpg">the chair _ONE</a>, by Konstantin
			Grcic.<br><br>The dimensions of faces (a) and (b) - the only in contact with the surface below -
			were
			finetuned through several rapid prototyping iterations, to find the optimal trade-off between
			stability
			and handling comfort.

		<h2>Rapid prototyping</h2>
		<p>Prototyping was crucial to find a pleasant grip that still wouldn't tumble over
			The sequential iterations of the grip design (from top to bottom) were 3D printed in two
			halves, and had blades provided by the manufacturer attached to one end.
			The last one, in black, is an injection test. The prototypes were then brought to lunch at restaurants,
			to be tested.
