		<h6>UID Devices</h6>
		<p class="caption">2015 - Interaction Design - 1-month student project</p>
		<p>A pop-up exhibition for UID'15. UID Yearly events are often home to an anxious lot. With this in
			mind, and in order to engage the public in a pop-up exhibition, we designed
			a set of "UID Devices" that could be interacted with throughout the event.</p>
	</div>
	<section>
		<h2>The users</h2>
		<p> People attending UID'15. Especially students presenting thesis projects, or people
			eager to network, that might be feeling anxious and stage-frightened.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>The needs</h2>
		<p>Having had presentation classes (and classes with presentations) throughout the year,
			we were able to spot common afflictions to a person speaking publicly.</p>

		<h2>Ideation</h2>
		<p>We chose three questions that seemed the most common: How do I look? Am I being heard? Are my
			hands shaking?
			If people could have an answer to these questions, perhaps they'd be a little less
			anxious before presenting or talking to someone.</p>

		<h2>Concept</h2>
		<h6><span class="highlight-1">REASSURING</span>,</h6>
		<h6><span class="highlight-2">FUNNY</span> + </h6>
		<h6><span class="highlight-3">SPARK INTERACTION</span></h6>
		<p>The main attributes for the devices "personality" were guided by the needs of the public:
			anxious users would benefit from <span class="highlight-1">soothing and reassuring answers</span>; <span
				class="highlight-2">funny</span> answers could also help to break the ice. At the same time, these
			answers should <span class="highlight-3">spark interaction</span> between atendess.

			<br><br>
			This attributes are reached by the design through the semantics of the given answers: they're
			reassuring because <span id="highlight-1">"low markings" are delivered with a kind tone</span>; also,
			the hyperbolic
			nature of the <span id="highlight-2">"top markings" are non-sensical and fun</span>. The <span
				id="highlight-3">gamification of the ranking system</span> sparks interaction between atendees,
			as they feel compelled to "challenge" each other.

			<h6>NO. 1 - Voice Inspector
			</h6>
			<p>
				Built with a microhpone inside, it ranks the volume of the voice of a person talking in front of
				it.
				The minimum value - "lovely whisper" - aims to be kind instead of accusing.

			</p>
		</div>

			<img src="../images/looksinspectorCrop.jpg"></img>
			<h6>NO. 2 - Looks Inspector
			</h6>
			<p>
				With a presence detector and a mirror, it tells the person standing in front of it wheter he
				or she look OK. In fact, it only randomly blinks green or yellow (67% and 33% odds), but the
				red was kept there so people can feel reassured they didn't get it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<img src="../images/stressinspectorCrop.jpg"></img>
			<h6>NO. 3 - Stress inspector</h6>
			<p>
				A game where the user tries to bring the key from one end of the rail to the other without
				touching,
				and can check his or her score along the markings, to compare and challenge others.

		<h2>Process video</h2>
		<p>
			The devices were hung on the entrance foyer wall of the Umea Institute of Design during it's
			annual event in 2015: UID'15. The video below documents the process as well as the public
			response to them.
